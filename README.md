#Bounty Hunter

![Bounty Hunter App](http://tclee.github.io/BountyHunter/images/screenshot.jpg "Bounty Hunter App")

This sample is based on the original iBountyHunter project found in the 
Head First iPhone and iPad development (which is a wonderful book 
for learning iOS development). 

The original iBountyHunter project only supported iOS 4. This new and
improved BountyHunter project supports all the latest iOS 5 features 
(i.e. Storyboard, ARC).
